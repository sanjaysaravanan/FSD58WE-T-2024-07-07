Recap:
  1. What is hook?
      Sort of hooking to the VDOM, controls the rendering of VDOM
      
      Eg: useState --> helps in re-rendering whenever any changes in the state happens.
       useState --> Help creating state variable

  2. State vs Props:
        Props ---> static values passed during rendering
        Eg:
          <Todo isCompleted={false} lastDate={'2023-01-01'}  />
          isCompleted, lastDate props

        State --> a value changes causing the re-rendering
          <Counter initialValue={10} />, initialValue ---> prop

          count value that changes inside the component is called state

Topics:

  0. Parent & Child Component


  1. Passing Data from Parent to Child Component
      passing the data from parent to child using the props ( child props )


     Passing Data from child to parent ( complex scenario )
      is possible only via a function passed as prop to the child

      this function will take the data as an argument when it is invoked/executed inside the child component

  2. Reusable Components:
      Trying to re-reuse the parts of the design

      Always look for commanalities in the design and write resusable components with same component with different set of props to identify & different design in the single component

  3. Component Life Cycle:

      Initialization: JS Loads the JSX into the memory

      Mounting: JSX gets loaded into the RealDOM

      Updating: Some contents or state gets updated in the Component JSX

      Unmounting: Removing the component JSX from the RealDOM

  4. Life Cycle Hook - useEffect

      We are gonna target each of the phases and we are going to do something those phases( Mounting, Updating, Unmounting )

      Mounted: useEffect with Mounted
        Examples: Calculating initial value or loading some data from APIs
    
      Updated: Liking a particular product / post in instagram

      Unmounting: Deleting a product from Cart

  5. CRUD implementations for the students or similar application

  6. Props Drilling
